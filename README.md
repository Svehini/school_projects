Some projects from assignments, mostly from Vienna

SAKODAS_MODEL.py:
The file sakoda's model, is a program that shows the segragation of blue vs red, (or X vs O) in a neighborhood. This program will ask for some inputs of number of rows and number of columns in the neighborhood. It will also ask about the number of total neighbors living there, and the distribution for blue and red neighbors. It will also ask for the percentage of similar neighbors, which if the percentage given is 75%, atleast 75% of all neighbors (not including empty spaces) must be the same kind as themselves. It will print out the mapping of the neighborhood for each iteration.

ASSIGNMENT1.py:
This assignment was from a subject at Technische Universität in Vienna called Recommender systems. Here we made a basic recommender system using the panda's Dataframe. We recieved a halfdone code, which we were to finish, so my code is the code underneath the "#YOUR CODE HERE" prompt.

ASSIGNMENT2.ipynb, ASSIGNMENT3.ipynb & ASSIGNMENT4.ipynb:
These were all assignments from recommender systems aswell, but these three assignments were more connected. Her we got some halfdone code, which we were to finish. This code wont work without the csv files, but since they´re over 25MB, I was not able to add them to GitHub. 

In these three assignments I made some different types of recommender systems, which used different types of recommening, such as Content Based recommending, User-Used recommending and Item-Item recommendation. My part of the code is the code under the line "#YOUR CODE HERE"
